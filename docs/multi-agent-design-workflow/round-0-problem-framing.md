# Round 0 - Problem Framing

Status: `draft`
Date: `2026-05-02`
Repo: `C:\Users\User\Documents\crypto-bot-ccg2`

## Goal of This Round

Frame the problem before selecting a solution. Round 0 should end with a shared understanding of what the crypto bot is supposed to do, who it serves, what constraints matter, and which unknowns must be resolved before architecture begins.

Round 0 does not choose libraries, exchanges, strategies, infrastructure, or implementation details unless they are already fixed constraints.

## Known Facts

- The repository is newly initialized and currently has no committed project files.
- The requested workflow uses four roles:
  - `Codex-Architect`
  - `Claude`
  - `Gemini`
  - `Codex-Arbiter`
- The project name suggests a crypto bot, but the exact product scope is not yet defined.

## Working Problem Statement

ASSUMPTION: This repo will contain a crypto trading or crypto automation bot.

The immediate problem is not yet "build the bot." The immediate problem is to define what kind of bot this should be, what risk boundaries it must obey, what success looks like, and what information the design team needs before proposing an architecture.

## Round 0 Prompts

### Codex-Architect

Answer:

1. What system boundaries are implied by a crypto bot?
2. What architectural decisions are blocked until requirements are clearer?
3. What repo structure would remain flexible while the product scope is still unknown?
4. What facts must be gathered before Round 1 candidate designs?

### Claude

Answer:

1. Who is the likely user or operator of this bot?
2. What could go wrong if the bot is underspecified?
3. Which human decisions should not be automated yet?
4. What language in the goal is ambiguous and needs clarification?

### Gemini

Answer:

1. What are the plausible interpretations of "crypto bot"?
2. Which alternative framings should be considered before architecture?
3. What external constraints could dominate the design?
4. What is the fastest way to reduce uncertainty?

### Codex-Arbiter

After the three design agents answer, produce:

1. Canonical problem statement.
2. In-scope and out-of-scope boundaries.
3. Blocking questions.
4. Non-blocking assumptions.
5. Decision on whether to proceed to Round 1.

## Initial Agent Notes

### Codex-Architect

Read of the problem:

The repo needs a design workflow before implementation. Because the repo is empty, the first architecture decision is process-level: create a repeatable decision protocol that prevents premature framework or exchange choices.

Key observations:

- There are no existing app, config, tests, or deployment conventions to preserve.
- Crypto bots often need boundaries around market data ingestion, strategy evaluation, execution, risk controls, state, logging, and observability.
- Trading execution, if in scope, raises reliability, security, and financial-risk requirements immediately.

Assumptions:

- ASSUMPTION: The user wants this workflow to guide future implementation, not just produce a one-time discussion.
- ASSUMPTION: The project may evolve from design docs into code after the problem is framed.

Questions:

- QUESTION: Is this bot for live trading, paper trading, alerts, portfolio monitoring, backtesting, or some combination?
- QUESTION: Which exchanges, chains, wallets, or data providers are in scope?
- QUESTION: Is the bot allowed to place orders automatically?
- QUESTION: What maximum loss, position sizing, and kill-switch rules are mandatory?
- QUESTION: Should this run locally, on a VPS, in containers, or as a cloud service?

Recommendation:

Keep Round 0 focused on risk boundaries and operating mode. Do not choose a tech stack until the bot type and automation level are clear.

Risks:

- A generic "crypto bot" architecture could accidentally optimize for live execution when the real need is research, alerts, or backtesting.
- Security design changes dramatically if private keys or exchange API keys are stored in this repo or runtime environment.

### Claude

Read of the problem:

The most important ambiguity is human intent. A crypto bot can be a helper, a signal generator, a trading system, or a fully autonomous financial actor. Those are different products with different safety expectations.

Key observations:

- The user has requested a multi-agent design process, which suggests they want stronger deliberation before coding.
- The repo name alone does not define the operator, risk tolerance, capital exposure, or legal environment.

Assumptions:

- ASSUMPTION: The operator is likely the repo owner or a small private team.
- ASSUMPTION: The first useful output is a disciplined set of questions, not a complete design.

Questions:

- QUESTION: What decisions should remain human-approved?
- QUESTION: What should the bot do when market data, exchange APIs, or network connections fail?
- QUESTION: How should the operator review, override, pause, or audit bot behavior?
- QUESTION: What is the acceptable balance between speed, safety, and explainability?

Recommendation:

Define the operator journey first: configure, observe, approve or reject actions, pause, recover, and audit. That journey should shape the architecture.

Risks:

- Underdefining human controls can turn a useful assistant into an unsafe automation system.
- A technically correct bot can still fail the project if its behavior is not explainable to the operator.

### Gemini

Read of the problem:

"Crypto bot" has several plausible meanings. The design should not collapse into a single interpretation until the project chooses one.

Possible framings:

- Trading executor: consumes strategy signals and places orders.
- Alerting bot: monitors markets and notifies the user.
- Research bot: gathers data and performs analysis.
- Backtesting engine: tests strategies over historical data.
- Portfolio assistant: tracks balances, PnL, and exposure.
- On-chain automation bot: watches contracts or wallets and submits transactions.

External constraints:

- Exchange API limitations, rate limits, and regional access.
- Custody model and secret management.
- Market data quality and latency requirements.
- Tax, audit, and record retention needs.
- Hosting environment and uptime expectations.

Questions:

- QUESTION: Which framing best matches the first milestone?
- QUESTION: Is real money involved in milestone 1?
- QUESTION: Are signals/rules already defined, or is strategy design part of this repo?
- QUESTION: Does the bot need a UI, CLI, chat interface, API, or only background jobs?

Recommendation:

Pick a narrow first milestone and design around that. The fastest uncertainty reducer is a one-page product brief answering: mode, user, assets, exchange/data source, automation level, and success metric.

Risks:

- Trying to support all crypto-bot framings at once will produce a large but weak architecture.
- On-chain bots and exchange-trading bots have different failure modes and should not be casually merged.

## Codex-Arbiter Synthesis

Canonical problem statement:

This repo needs a deliberate design process for a crypto automation project whose exact scope is not yet defined. Before architecture begins, the team must determine the bot's operating mode, automation level, user controls, risk boundaries, and first milestone.

In scope for Round 0:

- Clarifying bot type and first milestone.
- Identifying risk, safety, and human-control requirements.
- Recording blocking questions and assumptions.
- Preparing for candidate architecture designs in Round 1.

Out of scope for Round 0:

- Selecting a final tech stack.
- Choosing exchange SDKs or trading libraries.
- Writing trading strategy code.
- Designing live order execution flows.

Blocking questions:

- Is milestone 1 live trading, paper trading, alerts, backtesting, portfolio tracking, research, or on-chain automation?
- Will the bot handle real funds or private keys in milestone 1?
- What user approval or kill-switch controls are required?
- What exchange, chain, wallet, or market-data source is targeted first?
- What interface should the operator use first: CLI, web UI, chat, API, or background service only?

Non-blocking assumptions:

- The repo is early enough that workflow docs can define the decision process.
- The first implementation should be narrow and reversible.
- Safety and auditability should be treated as first-class design concerns.

Decision:

Do not proceed to Round 1 candidate designs until the blocking questions above are answered or explicitly accepted as assumptions.

Next actions:

1. User answers the blocking questions.
2. Codex-Arbiter updates this document with the chosen first milestone.
3. Round 1 begins with candidate designs constrained to that milestone.
